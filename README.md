##This repository contains the implementation of a Singly Linked List with basic operations including Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal. A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where 
  each node contains two components:
  
-Data - The actual data stored in the node.
-Next - A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
